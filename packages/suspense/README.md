* [View the changelog](https://github.com/bvaughn/suspense/blob/main/packages/suspense/CHANGELOG.md)

### ⚠️ Considerations

1. Suspense is an experimental, pre-release feature; **these APIs will change** along with React.
1. This package depends on `react@experimental` and `react-dom@experimental` versions.
