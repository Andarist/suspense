          A "thenable" is any object that defines a <code>then</code> method
          that can be used to observe success or failure. (Promises are the most
          common example of thisâ€“ although you can also implement your own).
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>isThenable</code> can be used to determine if a value is a
          "thenable" or not.
